        <p>Como dato curioso, los creadores del juego hicieron que las luchas contra los jefes tuvieran dos fases: 
            en la primer fase solo se escucha la instrumental de la canción y cuando llega la fase final en la que 
            los jefes lo dan todo se introduce la voz de del vocalista y la increíble letra de cada una de estas canciones.

                <h3>rules of nature</h3>

                <p>The time has come to an end <br>
                    Yeah – this is what nature planned <br>
                    Being tracked by a starving beast <br>
                    Looking for its daily feast <br>
                    A predator on the verge of death <br>
                    Close to its last breath <br>
                    Getting close to its last breath <br>
                    <br>
                    (Rules of nature) <br>
                    <br>
                    And they run when the sun comes up <br>
                    With their lives on the line <br>
                    (Alive) <br>
                    For a while <br>
                    (No choice) <br>
                    Gotta follow the laws of the wild <br>
                    (Alive) <br>
                    With their lives on the line <br>
                    (No choice) <br>
                    Out here only the strong survive <br>
                    <br>
                    What’s done is done <br>
                    Survived to see another day <br>
                    The dance of life <br>
                    The hunter and the agile prey <br>
                    No guarantee <br>
                    Of which of them will succeed <br>
                    Strong or weak <br>
                    <br>
                    (Yell) <br>

                <h3>i'm my own master now</h3>

                <p>Born <br>
                    Into a pack <br>
                    There’s no choice <br>
                    But take orders to attack <br>
                    Locked up in chains <br>
                    I get fed <br>
                    But the hunger still remains <br>
                    <br>
                    Not content to live this way <br>
                    Being led by the blind <br>
                    Got to plan my dispersal <br>
                    Time to leave them all behind <br>
                    <br>
                    Breaking out of my pain <br>
                    Nothing ventured, nothing gained <br>
                    I’m my own master now <br>
                    <br>
                    Bear the mark of my scars <br>
                    Shedding blood underneath the stars <br>
                    But I will survive somehow <br>
                    <br>
                    Ooh <br>
                    Ooh <br>
                    
                    Hear me howl <br>
                    Time to leave them all behind <br>
                    I’m my own master now

                <h3>a stranger i remain</h3>

                <p>I’ve come here from nowhere <br>
                    Across the unforgiving sea <br>
                    Drifting further and further <br>
                    It’s all becoming clear to me <br>
                    But violent winds are upon us and I can’t sleep <br>
                    Internal temperatures rising <br>
                    And all the voices won’t recede <br>
                    <br>
                    I’ve finally found what I was looking for <br>
                    A place where I can be without remorse <br>
                    Because I am a stranger who has found <br>
                    An even stranger war <br>
                    I’ve finally found what I was looking for <br>
                    <br>
                    Here I come <br>
                    <br>
                    La chaleur me dérange <br>
                    Mais c’est le grincement du bateau qui m’a réveillé <br>
                    <br>
                    I sharpen the knife <br>
                    And look down upon the bay <br>
                    For all of my life <br>
                    A stranger I remain <br>
                    A stranger I remain <br>
                    A stranger I remain

                <p>Wash away the anger <br>
                    <br>
                    Here I stand beneath <br>
                    The warm and soothing rain <br>
                    The droplets falling <br>
                    Gently down on the terrain <br>
                    Wash away the sorrow <br>
                    All the stains of time <br>
                    But there’s no memory <br>
                    It’s only dry inside <br>
                    <br>
                    In the mud and sinking deeper <br>
                    Into a peaceful life <br>
                    <br>
                    And it will come <br>
                    Like a flood of pain <br>
                    Pouring down on me <br>
                    And it will not let up <br>
                    Until the end is here <br>
                    <br>
                    And it will come <br>
                    Through the darkest day <br>
                    In my final hour <br>
                    And it will never rest <br>
                    Until the clouds are clear <br>
                    Until it finds my dreams have disappeared <br>
                    <br>
                    My dreams disappear

                        Golden rays of the glorious sunshine <br>
                        Sending down such a blood-red light <br>
                        Now the animals slowly retreat <br>
                        To the shadows, out of sight <br>
                        Arid winds blow across the mountains <br>
                        Giving flight to the birds of prey <br>

                        To transform Eden, day by day <br>

                        The vulture waits to see what rots <br>

                        Oh, how pretty <br>

                        This is nature’s sacrifice <br>

                        When the air blows through <br>

                        The truth goes unspoken <br>
                        I’ve even forgotten my name <br>

                        A desolate place (place) <br>
                        Without any trace (trace) <br>
                        It’s only the cold wind I feel <br>

                        There will be blood-shed <br>
                        The man in the mirror nods his head <br>
                        The only one left <br>
                        Will ride upon the dragon’s back <br>

                        But in the end it has to be this way <br>
                        <br>
                        I’ve carved my own path <br>
                        You followed your wrath <br>
                        But maybe we’re both the same <br>
                        <br>
                        The world has turned <br>
                        And so many have burned <br>
                        But nobody is to blame <br>
                        <br>
                        Yet staring across this barren wasted land <br>
                        I feel new life will be born <br>
                        Beneath the blood stained sand <br>
                        <br>
                        Beneath the blood stained sand
                    </p>
